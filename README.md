# Web Scraping Portfolio
Here I will put my web scraping projects.

### raspagem.py 
This archive has a web scraping project that collects all the names, URLs, and prices of a given product posted in the e-commerce Mercado Livre (a common Brazilian e-commerce site). After collecting this information, the script saves the three items in new rows of a DataFrame. Finally, a table in Excel format (.xlsx) is saved on your PC.

If you have any contributions, please, commit to a new branch.
